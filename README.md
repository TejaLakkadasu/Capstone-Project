# Capstone-Project
Diabetes patients readmission prediction.

The domain of this Capstone Project falls under the purview of “Healthcare Analytics”. The Capstone project will present the analysis of a large clinical database that was undertaken to examine the historical patterns of diabetes care in patients with diabetes admitted to a US hospital and to indicate future directions which will lead to a reduction in hospital readmission rate and improvements in patient care. The need for readmission indicates that inadequate care was provided to the patient at the time of first admission. Inadequate care poses threat to patients’ life and treatment of readmitted patients leads to increased healthcare costs.
